**Scheduler-Bot**
Simple scheduler bot for my game group.
/scheduler_setup adds the channel where the command is used along with the server to the bots database for it track player availability.
Users clicks on a react that lines up with the timeblock they are unavailable for. every 5 minutes the bot checks for changes in the database, and if availability has changed, removes the post holding the image and makes a new one accordingly.
